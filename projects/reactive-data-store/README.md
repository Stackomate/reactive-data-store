# Reactive Data Store

A Typescript Library for Action-Based Reactive State Management.

## Why?

Managing Application State is often difficult. For example, we have the following requirements:
* Atomic Updates.
* Reacting to an Action or to a value change.
* Declaring data derived from State.
* Deciding when and in which order to Recompute derived data.
* Making Reactive Data modular and reusable.

ReactiveState solves the problems above.
