/* Ideas

Imagine/Dream: Create a hypothetical transaction that will be computed, but not applied.
Probably listeners won't fire either.
Dynamic reordering: Prop can "delay"/pause its execution, add new dependencies for later
Dynamic emission: Prop can choose different outputs(actions) for different dependants.
Useful for "If" structure
Shortcuts for INACTIVE values: could have side effects on next re render?
